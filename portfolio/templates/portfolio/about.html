As well as being able to create games ðŸ˜Š you get to tell the computer what to do, so there is a huge scope for creativity with endless possibilities and challenges! <br> Being ardent to pursue this as a career, I began studying the Bachelor of Engineering Course in Computer Science in 2017 at Anglia Ruskin University, where I graduated with a First-Class degree in 2021. <br> My current interest in technology is Artificial Intelligence with Machine Learning as it involves training a machine so that it can imitate the behaviour of intelligent humans, it can eliminate the risk of human error, and avoid the arduous, repetitive tasks for us!  If trained well AI can even outperform humans in certain aspects ( for example, for checking identity documents, it can flag up potential fraud by noticing subtle details which maybe harder for the human eye to notice). Again the scope is endless for what we can train our AI models to do! <br><br> I currently have just over 2 years of commercial experience as a software engineer and I am eager to grow and to someday reach senior/principal level. My current tech stack is C# & .Net (been working with for âˆ¼ 4 years, I used this throughout my time on the Computer Science course) and Python (around 2 years), but I have also worked with other programming languages to a lesser extent including C++, Java, C, Matlab, Octave, SQL,Dart and AngularJS. I am also keen to work with new programming languages and to pick them up quickly, for instance, in one of my roles I had gone from knowing nothing about Dart and Flutter, to creating architecture and apps in the space of a month! <br><br> Outside of coding, I play chess
